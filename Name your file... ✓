## 📊 Visuals Included + What They Show

### 1. **Cost by Shipping Mode and Product Importance**
Compares average product cost across shipment types (Flight, Road, Ship) and product priority (High, Medium, Low).  
🔍 *Insight:* Costs were surprisingly flat — a red flag for deeper pricing review.

### 2. **Customer Ratings by Product Importance**
Stacked bar chart showing total customer ratings split by product priority.  
🔍 *Insight:* Medium-priority products dominated both volume and ratings.

### 3. **Customer Ratings Breakdown (Pie Chart)**

🔍 *Insight:* Medium-priority items generated over 48% of all customer reviews.

### 4. **Discount Trends Across Shipping Modes (Scatter Plot)**
Compares discounts vs. cost across shipping methods.  
🔍 *Insight:* Some higher-cost items are still being discounted — possibly reducing margins unnecessarily.

### 5. **Sales Distribution by Mode of Shipment (Treemap)**
Treemap showing total discounts by shipment type.
